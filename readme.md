# LM80C - A Z80-based homebrew computer

This repo contains the matherial illustrated in a series of articles of mine where I'm trying to build a Z80-based homebrew computer as a sort of "back to the past".

Every folder summarizes a step in this path: it illustrates with pictures my achievements, and stores what it's needed to replicate my tests, like code, schematics and other stuff.

Fell free to suggest any improvements you think.
